- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Matt McCall. I am a software developer living in Chattanooga, TN.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in full stack development technologies and languages (Javascript, Java, Python, GO, React, Angular, NodeJS).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently spening all of my time coding through leetcode. I am relearning how to effectily tackle algorithms in different coding languages. I was attempting to push code weekly to my github, but I feel my time is better spent coding algorithms for now. I plan to come back after I feel comfortable with dynamic programming.
